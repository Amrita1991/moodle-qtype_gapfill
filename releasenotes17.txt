Version 1.7 of the Moodle Gapfill question type contributed by Marcus Green
This is maintenance version with no new features. The purpose of this version is
to ensure the question type will work with Moodle 2.9. This is required because the
JQuery code in the previous version of Gapfill would not work with 2.9. The versions
of JQuery, JQuery UI and touchpunch (for mobile support) have been updated the calls
are taken from the way JQuery is used in the ordering question type. Credit to 
Gordon Bateson for this.

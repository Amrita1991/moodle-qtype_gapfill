Version 1.5 of the Moodle Gapfill question type contributed by Marcus Green
The only new feature is the double knot or !! to indicate that a gap can be left empty and considered a correct response.
This is of particular use with the | or operator where one or more answers or a blank will be considered correct e.g. [cat|dog|||]. 

This is illustrated in a new sample question in the sample_questions.xml files shipped with this question type 
called "Correct_empty_gaps with !!"  As part of this change the calculation of maximum score per question instance has been modified
to allow for the !! blanks.

The upgrade.php file has been changed to fix an issue that may occur with databases other than MySQL.

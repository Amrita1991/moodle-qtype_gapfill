Version 1.5 of the Moodle Gapfill question type contributed by Marcus Green
This version has two significant new feature is the double knot or !! and the fixedgapsize setting. 
The use of !! indicates that a gap can be left empty and considered a correct response.

This is of particular use with the | or operator where one or more answers or a blank will be considered correct e.g. [cat|dog|!!]. 

This is illustrated in a new sample question in the sample_questions.xml files shipped with this question type 
called "Correct_empty_gaps with !!"  As part of this change the calculation of maximum score per question instance has been modified, so "The [cat] sat on the [!!]" each gap will be worth 1 mark. This is necessary to ensure that if a value is put in the [!!] space a mark will be lost.

The upgrade.php file to use XMLDB to fix issues with databases other than MySQL.

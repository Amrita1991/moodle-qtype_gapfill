<h2>Support for the Gapfill Question Type</h2>
<p>I have been working on automatically marked web based
questions&nbsp; for over 14 years.(since before Moodle was
released).&nbsp;Version 1.0 of the Gapfill question type was
released in October 2012 and the most recent version (1.4 was released
in January 2014). Each version has been updated to work with the latest
version of Moodle either before the Moodle release or within weeks of
the Moodle release. The current version has been extensively tested
with Moodle 2.7 since that code was in alpha release.&nbsp; Moodle 2.7
is due
to be a LTS version (Long Term Support)&nbsp; until June 2017 meaning
Gapfill is guaranteed to support a current version of Moodle until
then.
My history of responding to questions and feedback can be viewed in the
comments section of the Gapfill plugin (and also in the comments on the
Google Adsense block going back to November 2011). Most questions have
been responded to within 24 hours.<br>
</p>
<p>The Gapfill question type is written using the standard Moodle
programming
interface and in the event of my being unable to continue support the
program any competent programmer would be able to update to any
forseeable Moodle update at a relatively minor cost.</p>
<h2>Background to the plugin<br>
</h2>
<p>Gapfill was developed entirely in my own time and is not dependent
on any third party finance or the nature of my employment. I have been
contributing to the Moodle discussion forums since
spring 2003 <a
href="https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=844#p5319"
target="_blank">https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=844#p5319</a>&nbsp;
and have made approximatly 2,000 posts in that time, largely in the
Quiz forum. Around 2010 I began to investigate ways of making the core
Cloze question type easier to use. I decided it made more sense to
create an entirely new question type and in May 2012 proposed a new
Gapfill question type.&nbsp;
<a href="https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=203802"
target="_blank">https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=203802</a>.
The question type has now been downloaded over 11,000 times.</p>
<p>Prior to working with Moodle I was the author and co-author of
several books about the Certified Java Programmers exam (<a
href="http://www.jchq.net" target="_blank">http://www.jchq.net</a>).&nbsp;
As part of this I developed three different quiz engines, one using
Java Applets, one using Java Servlets and one using PHP. The first
version was made publicly available in the year 2000 and received&nbsp;
a significant amount of traffic. My subsequent work informed my
development of the Gapfill question type.<br>
